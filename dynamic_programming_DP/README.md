Simple Explanation for a Kid:

Imagine you have a big puzzle to solve, and it's so huge that you can't solve it all at once. But you notice that the puzzle has smaller parts that are repeated. Dynamic programming is like solving those smaller parts first and remembering their solutions so that you don't have to solve them again when you encounter them later. It's like breaking a big problem into smaller problems and being smart about solving them!
Detailed Explanation for a Computer Science Student:

Concept:
Dynamic programming (DP) is a technique used to solve optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems. The key idea is to solve each subproblem only once and store its solution to avoid redundant computations.

Process:

Identify Optimal Substructure: Break the main problem into smaller subproblems, and make sure solving each subproblem contributes to solving the main problem optimally.

Memoization or Tabulation: Use either a top-down approach (memoization) or a bottom-up approach (tabulation).
1. Memoization (Top-down): Solve the problem recursively, but store solutions to subproblems and reuse them to avoid redundant computations.
2. Tabulation (Bottom-up): Solve subproblems iteratively, starting from the smallest ones, and build up to the main problem.

Implementation:
Consider the Fibonacci sequence as an example. The naive recursive solution has exponential time complexity, but dynamic programming can significantly improve efficiency.

Memoization (in Python):

```python

def fib_memo(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    memo[n] = fib_memo(n-1, memo) + fib_memo(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

Tabulation (in Python):

```python

def fib_tab(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    fib = [0] * (n + 1)
    fib[1], fib[2] = 1, 1
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]
    return fib[n]
```

LeetCode Problems to Focus On:

1. Climbing Stairs (70): A classic DP problem where you can reach the top by either climbing 1 or 2 steps at a time.
2. Coin Change (322): Given different coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to make up a certain amount.
3. Longest Increasing Subsequence (300): Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array
4. Knapsack Problem (0/1) (494): Given weights and values of items, find the maximum value that can be obtained with a knapsack of a fixed capacity.

These problems cover a range of dynamic programming concepts and are commonly asked in interviews. Understanding how to apply DP to different scenarios will enhance your problem-solving skills.
