# Trees (Overview):

## Binary Tree:
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child.
- **Depth (or level):** The depth of a node is the number of edges on the path from the root to that node.
- **Height:** The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf.

## Binary Search Tree (BST):
A binary search tree is a binary tree with the additional property that the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

## Tree Traversal:
- In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal algorithms.
- Level-order (BFS) traversal.

## Balanced Binary Trees:
AVL trees and Red-Black trees are examples of balanced binary search trees.

## Binary Heap:
A binary heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property (either min-heap or max-heap).


# Basic Concepts:

## Definition:
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Node:
Each node in a binary tree contains data and two pointers/references to its left and right children.

## Root:
The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root.

## Parent, Child, Sibling:
A node is the parent of its left and right children. Nodes with the same parent are siblings.

## Leaf Node:
A node with no children is called a leaf node or a terminal node.

## Depth and Height:
Depth of a node is the number of edges on the path from the root to that node. Height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf.

## Binary Tree Properties:
The maximum number of nodes at level 'l' is 2^l. The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height 'h' is 2^(h+1) - 1.

# Types of Binary Trees:

## Full Binary Tree:
Every node has either 0 or 2 children.

## Complete Binary Tree:
All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.

## Perfect Binary Tree:
All levels are completely filled, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

## Balanced Binary Tree:
The height of the left and right subtrees of every node differs by at most one.

# Traversal Algorithms:

## In-Order Traversal:
Visit the left subtree, visit the root, visit the right subtree.
- "In" refers to the fact that you visit the nodes in the order of their occurrence in an in-order sequence.
- The traversal visits the left subtree first, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
- For a binary search tree (BST), an in-order traversal produces sorted output.

## Pre-Order Traversal:
Visit the root, visit the left subtree, visit the right subtree.
- "Pre" stands for "pre-root" or "before the root."
- The traversal starts by visiting the root first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
- It is often used to create a copy of the tree or to evaluate an expression in prefix notation.

## Post-Order Traversal:
Visit the left subtree, visit the right subtree, visit the root.
- "Post" stands for "post-root" or "after the root."
- The traversal visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.
- Post-order traversal is often used to delete nodes from a tree or to evaluate an expression in postfix notation.

## Level-Order Traversal (BFS):
Visit nodes level by level, from left to right.
- The term "level-order" refers to visiting nodes level by level, starting from the root and moving to the next level.
- Nodes at the same level are visited from left to right.
- Level-order traversal is often implemented using a queue and is useful for discovering the structure of the tree level by level.

# Binary Search Tree (BST):

## Definition:
A binary search tree is a binary tree where, for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node.

## Insertion:
Algorithm for inserting a value into a BST while maintaining the BST property.

## Deletion:
Algorithm for deleting a node from a BST while maintaining the BST property.

# Common Binary Tree Problems:

## Path Sum:
Determine if a path exists in the tree with a given sum.

## Symmetric Tree:
Check if a binary tree is symmetric around its center.

## Maximum Depth:
Find the maximum depth (height) of a binary tree.

## Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA):
Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree.

## Serialize and Deserialize:
Convert a binary tree to a string (serialization) and vice versa (deserialization).

## Maximum Path Sum:
Find the maximum sum of any path in a binary tree.

# Tips for Problem Solving:

## Recursion:
Many binary tree problems are elegantly solved using recursion. Understand how to apply recursion for tree traversal and problem-solving.

## Use of Additional Data Structures:
Sometimes, using additional data structures (e.g., hash maps) can simplify solving certain problems.

## Understanding BST Properties:
When dealing with BST problems, leverage the properties of a BST for efficient solutions.

## Tree Traversal Techniques:
Master in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal techniques.

## Handling Null Pointers:
Safely handle null pointers to avoid runtime errors.

## Optimizing Time and Space Complexity:
Strive to optimize both time and space complexity of your solutions.
